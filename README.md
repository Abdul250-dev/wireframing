# wireframing
Wireframing is the process of creating a simple visual guide—or blueprint—that represents the layout and structure of a digital interface like a website or mobile app.
It’s not focused on colors, images, or branding, but rather on:
- What elements appear on the screen (e.g., buttons, menus, forms)
- Where those elements are placed
- How the user will interact with them

Think of a wireframe as the architectural floor plan for a digital product. It shows how the space (screen or page) is organized before it's decorated or furnished.
 Why is Wireframing Important?
Wireframing is an essential early step in the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design process because it helps:

Visualize ideas quickly without the distraction of visual details.
Plan user journeys and how users interact with the system.
Gather feedback early from stakeholders or users before full development begins.
Save time and cost by identifying design or usability problems early on.

🛠️ What Does a Wireframe Include?

A wireframe typically contains:
Placeholders for text, images, and buttons
Basic layout using boxes, lines, and labels
An outline of the page structure (e.g., header, sidebar, main content, footer)
Optional notes about interactions or behaviors (e.g., "click this button to submit")

🧪 Example Scenario
Let’s say you're designing a booking system homepage. A wireframe might show:
A search bar at the top
A list of properties in the center
A menu bar at the bottom
Icons for profile, help, or notifications
No color. No real photos. Just shapes and labels showing the structure.


#Types of Wireframes
🆚 Low-Fidelity vs High-Fidelity Wireframes
Wireframes come in different levels of detail or "fidelity." The choice between low- and high-fidelity depends on the goals of the design phase, the audience, and the level of feedback needed.

📝 Low-Fidelity Wireframes
✅ What They Are:
Rough, basic sketches or outlines of a UI.

Focus on structure, layout, and flow, not visual design.

Often drawn by hand or created with basic shapes in tools like Balsamiq or pen and paper.

🧠 When to Use:
In the early stages of the design process.
When brainstorming ideas or testing concepts quickly.
When presenting to internal teams or gathering broad feedback.
🔍 Key Characteristics:
Black and white or grayscale.
Uses placeholders (e.g., boxes for images, “lorem ipsum” for text).
Prioritizes functionality over aesthetics.

🎨 High-Fidelity Wireframes
✅ What They Are:
Detailed representations of the UI that resemble the final product.
Includes typography, colors, spacing, UI components, and often some interactivity.

🧠 When to Use:
In the later stages of the design process.
Before handing designs off to developers.
When showcasing to stakeholders or clients for final approval.

🔍 Key Characteristics:
Accurate layout, fonts, and visual styles
Can simulate user interaction (e.g., click-through prototypes).
Typically created using advanced tools like Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch.
